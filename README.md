# Google collab test datasets for loading
For loading to google collab, and small zero-shot tests for LLM with csv files.
## Dataset 1: hate1.csv - Hate Speech Dataset with 4 rows
Entries were inspired by examples from toxigen, each example was modified more than 75% and the context or target was changed
Hate speech was watered down to be as mild as possible. Hate speech examples are not much different than simple internet trash talk anymore. It includes 2 "Hate Speech" and 2 "Not Hate Speech" examples.

These samples are not scientificially accurate nor annotated by experts. Only for easy of use for testing in google collab for a personal project.
